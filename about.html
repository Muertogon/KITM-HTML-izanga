        <h1> Jeff the ripper</h1>
        <p>Attacks ascribed to Jack the Ripper typically involved female prostitutes
            who lived and worked in the slums of the East End of London whose throats
            were cut prior to abdominal mutilations. The removal of internal organs from
            at least three of the victims led to proposals that their killer had some anatomical or surgical knowledge. </p>
